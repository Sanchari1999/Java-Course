- JDK: Java Development Kit. This is used for developing Java Program. So, this will have development tools that are useful for debugging or compiling the program.
- Once you have compiled the program, you need to execute it. JRE/ Java Runtime Environment is responsible for that. Java programs actually run inside JRE. JRE contains library of Java classes as well as JVM/ Java Virtual Machine.
- JVM will actually execute our Java programs.
- Suppose there is a Java file names “First.java”. “javac” is a compiler - development tool (part of JDK) will take this file and give us a file called “First.class”. To write this class file, we write the syntax: “java First”: “java” here is the runtime environment - this will execute the Java program. This step is done by JRE and JVM.
